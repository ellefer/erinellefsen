My research areas include reaction diffusion equations, nonlocal PDEs, ODEs, patch models, and their applications to modeling ecological processes such as territory formation, habitat fragmentation, and invasive species management.

I am also passionate about implementing modeling curriculum in the mathematics classroom. I also work on creating modeling scenarios that can be used in calculus and differential equations classrooms.
